# Flutterwave Flutter SDK

  

Flutterwave's Flutter SDK is Flutterwave's offical flutter sdk to integrate the Flutterwave payment into your flutter app. It comes with a readymade Drop In UI.

  
The payment methods currently supported are Cards, USSD, Mpesa, GH Mobile Money, UG Mobile Money, ZM Mobile Money, Rwanda Mobile Money, Franc Mobile Money and Nigeria Bank Account.


  

## Before you begin

- Ensure you have your test (and live) [API keys](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/api-keys).

  

## Adding it to your project
  

**Step 1.** Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

  

**Step 2.** Add the dependency

In your `pubspec.yaml` file add:

1. `flutterwave: 1.0.0`
2. run `pub get`



## Usage

### 1. Create a `Flutterwave` instance

Create a `Flutterwave` instance by calling the constructor `Flutterwave.UiPayment()` The `UiPayment` accepts a mandatory instance of the calling `Context` , `publicKey`, `encryptionKey`, `amount`, `currency`, `email`, `fullName`, `txRef`, `isDebugMode` and `phoneNumber` . It returns an instance of `Flutterwave`  which we then call the `async` method `.initializeForUiPayments()` on.

    void beginPayment async () { 
      try {  
		     final ChargeResponse response = await Flutterwave.UiPayment(  
	            context: build_context_here,
	            publicKey: "public_key_here",
	            encryptionKey: "encryption_key_here",  
	            isDebugMode: this.isDebug,
	            currency: FlutterwaveCurrency.NGN,
	            amount: "10",
	            email: "test_user@test.com",
	            fullName: "Flutterwave Test User",
	            txRef: "your_unique_ref_here",
	            narration: "your_payment_narration_here", 
	            phoneNumber: "user_phone_number", 
	            acceptBankTransferPayment: true,  
	            acceptAccountPayment = true,
	            acceptCardPayment = true,  
	            acceptUSSDPayment = true)
	            .initializeForUiPayments();
	         } catch(error) {
		         print(error.toString());
	         }



### 2. Handle the response

  Calling the `.initialiazeForUiPayments()` method returns a `Future`
 of `ChargeResponse` which we await for the actual response as seen above.
 
#### Please note that:
 - `ChargeResponse` can be null, depending on if the user cancels
   the transaction by pressing back.
 - You need to check the status of the transaction from the instance of `ChargeResponse` returned from calling `.initializeForUiPayments()`, the `amount`, `currency` and `txRef` are correct before providing value to the customer



>  **PLEASE NOTE**

> We advise you to do a further verification of transaction's details on your server to be sure everything checks out before providing service or goods.
